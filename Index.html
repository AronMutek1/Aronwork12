            <h3>Hello</h3>

            <h1>Im <span>Aron Mutek<br></span>A Web Developer</h1>

            <p>I’m a junior web developer with a passion for building and improving websites. 
                Skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I’m focused on creating clean, responsive designs that provide great user experiences.
                 I'm also exploring back-end development to gain a fuller understanding of how web applications work. 
                 Driven by curiosity and a desire to learn, I’m excited to take on new challenges,
                  work with experienced developers, and continuously grow my skills in this fast-paced field. </p>
